# Beer-Reddit

This is a Codecademy project. It started life as a site dedicated to a predetermined list of beer & homebrewing related subreddits.
Somewhere along the line, I added the functionality for additional topics and associated subreddits.

## This project uses:

1. JavaScript
2. HTML
3. React / Redux

### How it Works

1. There is a predefined array of topic objects.
2. There is a predefined array of associated subreddit objects.
